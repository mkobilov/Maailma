# Maailma
There is no code here, just none. If you are currently playing D&amp;D with me, please, for the sake of your own fun do not look there.

All others are welcome here. This is my first open world, so lots of inconsistencies are present. These are files containing all the info I currently have about this world, azgaar version on which map were created (because .map files were created on the old version and they're not working on newer one).
Material plane and it's previous version are in maps folder. All descriptions to different storylines and county description are in campaings->Maailma folder.
All dungeon are usually in .htm format using donjon dungeon 5e generator.


I am not a native speaker, so there will be a lot of mistakes, I guess. If you see something in brackets on unknown language, that's probably a translation.
P.S Have fun weaving your own stories in this world or copy some from it.
